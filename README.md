# WavTagger
Customizable Audio File Congregator &amp; Manager for Music Producers

# How to use:
Open app and enter settings to link your audio sample folders.

Once linked, you can begin customizing categories and associated tags, for example:  
  
Drums  
|  
|- clap  
|- snare  
|- hat  
|- kick  

On return to the main menu, WavTagger will automatically generate tags by filename and allow you to begin filtering by category and tags.
The main sample list supports auditioning of audio files, as well as drag-and-drop directly into your DAW of choice, onto a folder to create a copy, or any drag and drop supporting audio application.
